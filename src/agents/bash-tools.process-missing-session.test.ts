// Regression: `exec` announces a backgrounded command as "session <name>, pid
// <number>", so callers reach for the pid. Polling with the pid used to return
// a bare "No session found for 14540" — true, but a dead end. In a real
// scorecard run an agent spent its whole remaining budget recovering from it
// and failed a task it had otherwise solved. The error must say what a valid
// identifier looks like.
