/**
 * Detects the "described the fix but never made it" turn.

 * Observed case: asked to fix a failing test, a capable model diagnosed the bug
 * exactly right ("change `add` to return a + b instead of a - b"), printed the
 * corrected code, said "now let's run the test again to prove it passes" — and
 * ended the turn without calling a single mutating tool. The file was unchanged.
 * Nothing lied, so the false-success guard never fired; the work simply did not
 * happen, silently.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative, because a warning on a genuine "show me how to fix
 * this" answer would be noise. All three must hold:
 *   1. no mutating tool ran in the turn (a write/edit means it did act),
 *   2. the reply contains a fenced code block (it produced a concrete change),
 *   3. the reply promises to apply or run it, in the first person.
 * Explanations that merely show code do not match (3), so they stay quiet.
