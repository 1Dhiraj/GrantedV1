# HEARTBEAT.md is retired

OpenClaw no longer creates `HEARTBEAT.md` in new workspaces or reads it at runtime. Heartbeat instructions now live in the system-owned monitor's cron scratch in the shared state database.

Manage the current scratch with the monitor job id from `granted cron list --all`:

```bash
granted cron scratch <jobId>
granted cron scratch <jobId> --set "..."
granted cron scratch <jobId> --file notes.md
granted cron scratch <jobId> --unset
```

If an older workspace still contains `HEARTBEAT.md`, run `granted doctor --fix`. Doctor imports its instructions into monitor scratch, converts valid legacy `tasks:` entries into cron jobs, archives the original under the state directory, and removes the workspace file.
